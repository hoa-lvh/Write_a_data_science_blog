### Project Motivation
I used Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

This project focuses on answering the following questions:
‚What are the most common amenities in the listings?‚
"What attracts the guests most to renting a property?"
‚What are the most influential features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?‚
‚What is the impact of listings' proximity to Seattle Downtown in terms of price?


### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. Collections
7. Math


### File Descriptions
1. Seattle Airbnb Dataset.ipynb
Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualizations

2. seattleh.csv
